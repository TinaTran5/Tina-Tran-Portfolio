# Video Editing Portfolio Website

This project was created for an Interaction Design course and serves as a **portfolio website** to showcase my freelance video editing work. 
It was designed for **both mobile and desktop** audiences, with layouts built specifically for each.
The site highlights my editing style, presents selected work, and provides a clear way for potential clients to learn more and get in touch.


## Purpose
- **Target audience:** Content creators looking for a skilled and reliable video editor
- **Pain Points:** Many creators lack the time, tools, or expertise to produce polished content on their own
- **My Goal:**
  - To present a professional portfolio that builds trust with potential clients
  - To offer a clear and easy way for creators to connect and collaborate with me

## What I Learned
- Layouts for **desktop and mobile**
- Wireframing and UI design in **Figma**
  - Figma Sketch: https://www.figma.com/design/aVTejOEmr1ANOoo9x2jD9u/Portfolio?t=aDZsnQddOTXKSCAK-1
- Front-end development using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
- User-centered, iterative design process


## My Design Process
1. **Ideation:** Started with a Figma wireframe to plan the layout and user flow
2. **User-Centered Approach:** Designed with the needs of content creators in mind â€” prioritizing clarity, trust, and ease of contact
3. **Iteration:** Refined both mobile and desktop layouts based on feedback
4. **Implementation:** Developed the site using HTML and CSS for each section
